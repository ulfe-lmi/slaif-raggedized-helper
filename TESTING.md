# Verification contract

T01. Default product tests use synthetic owned fixtures and fake generator/embedding/reranker
interfaces; no key, network, GPU or model download. OAP tests use isolated temp repositories,
FIFOs and fake remote/tmux interfaces. Never exercise live project pipes during fixture tests.
T02. Run focused behavior/negative-path tests for the changed boundary. Add integration proof
for actual composition, filesystem crash/atomicity/concurrency, ACL, cancellations and retries.
Do not accept keyword/assertion-only checks as product behavior proof. Broad suites belong at
phase/release gates or when reproducing their failures, not repeated without a reason.
T03. Real route/model/GPU tests are opt-in and require exact authorized host/device/data/call
budgets, known profiles, fingerprints and safe rollback. Mock success is not real qualification.
Report PASSED/FAILED/SKIPPED/NOT RUN/BLOCKED/PENDING/MISSING exactly. No fake timing/usage/results.
T04. Keep final held-out evaluation separate from tuning and retain safe raw measurements.
Verify negative authorization, contradictory/insufficient evidence, source support, tokenizer
limits, FP16/FP32 parity, no direct fallback, corrupt snapshots, restart and mode contention.
T05. OAP scaffold check: `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests/oap -v`;
`python3 oap/bin/check_state.py --repo-root .` checks installed governance and orchestration.
Product foundation tests (objective 002-a): `uv sync --locked` then `uv run pytest tests/unit`
(synthetic fixtures only; no keys, network, GPU or model downloads; pytest exits 5 on empty
discovery, so the suite can never be falsely green by missing tests). The GitHub Actions
workflow `CI` (.github/workflows/oap.yml, see docs/CI.md) runs the OAP-scaffold checks
(Python 3.12-3.14) plus a product job: locked lightweight environment, real product tests,
OAP checks and lint from a clean checkout (Python 3.12/3.14). Required final-head checks are
read from live policy; zero checks never means product verification has passed.

T06. Real controlled HTTP/SSE behavior tests (objective 003-b): `uv run pytest
tests/integration -q` runs the transport and gateway suites against owned 127.0.0.1 loopback
servers that record exact path/headers/body; unique synthetic API-key canaries only. Still
synthetic and offline: no external network, product services, real keys, GPU or model
downloads. They prove wire-path resolution, total-deadline/retry/UNKNOWN_COMPLETION semantics,
literal SSE byte parsing, bounded queue backpressure, cancellation and the pinned Responses
dialect (see docs/generator-contract.md). The product CI job runs them alongside tests/unit
and product lint from a clean locked install.
